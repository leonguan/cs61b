Data Structures:
1. List Package
	* List - abstract class
		A list data structure that holds a size, is able to add to the front and back,
		check the items in the front and back, and check whether the list is empty.
	
    * DList extends List
    	The doubly-linked list data structure simply references a DListNode as its head.
    	We use a DList in WUGraph to store the list of vertices in the Graph.
    	The reason for this is because:
    		- it can insert in O(1) time (the list is unordered)
    		- iterate through in O(V) time (in order to obtain all vertices)
    	
        * public void insertFront(Object item) - inserts item at the front of the DList
        * public void insertBack(Object item) - inserts item at the back of the DList
        * public DListNode find(Object item) - return a DListNode that has the same item as the parameter if it exists. Otherwise, returns null
        * public ListNode front() - returns the DListNode at the front of the list
        * public ListNode back() - returns the DListNode at the back of the list
        
    * DListNode extends ListNode
    	A node representing a specific item in a doubly-linked list
    	We used this data structure for simplicity's sake since we had already written it in a past homework.
    	
        * public boolean isValidNode() - isValidNode returns true if this node is valid; false otherwise.
        * public ListNode next() - next() returns the node following this node.  If this node is invalid, throws an exception.
        * public ListNode prev() - prev() returns the node before this node.  If this node is invalid, throws an exception.
        * public void insertAfter(Object item) - insertAfter() inserts an item immediately following this node.  If this node is invalid, throws an exception.
        * public void insertBefore(Object item) - insertBefore() inserts an item immediately preceding this node.  If this node is invalid, throws an exception.
        * public void remove() - remove() removes this node from its DList.  If this node is invalid, throws an exception.


2. Queue Package
    * LinkedQueue implements Queue
    	A queue data structure. We used this specific LinkedQueue for simplicity's sake because we had already written and tested it in previous homeworks.
    	The most important reason we reused this is because  we had already implemented a quicksort method for it, which we would need for Kruskal's algorithm (part 2).
    	The fact that the data structure is a queue actually was not utilized in this project. We simply wanted to use a list-type data structure
    	that would allow us to add objects and then sort later.
    	
        * public int size() - returns the size of the LinkedQueue
        * public boolean isEmpty() - returns whether this is empty 
        * public void enqueue(Object item) - adds an item to the queue
        * public Object dequeue() - removes item at front of queue
        * public Object front() - returns item at front
        * public boolean find(Object item) - returns true if item in queue
        * public Object nth(int n) - returns object at nth position
        * public void append(LinkedQueue q) - appends the contents of q to the end of this in O(1) time

3. HashTable Package
    * HashTable implements Dictionary
    	We used the HashTable data structure that we created earlier in the semester to allow us to do look up in O(1) time.
    	We used the hashtable in several places where regular lookup in adjacency lists or linkedqueues would run on O(n)
    	By storing out objects in both the lists as well as the hashtable, we can check in the hashtable to determine whether or not
    	the objects were in the corresponding list.
    	We wrote hashcodes for the classes whose objects we were planning to hash.
    	
        * public int size() - returns number of items in HashTable
        * public boolean isEmpty() - returns true if this is empty
        * public Entry insert(Object item) - inserts an item into HashTable
        * public Entry find(Object item) - finds item in HashTable
        * public Entry remove(Object item) - removes item from HashTable
        * public void makeEmpty() - removes all items from HashTable
    * Entry
    	A container data structure that simply represents entries in the hash table. This was created along with the HashTable earlier in the semester.
        * public Object key - returns key
        * public Object value - returns value
        * public void setValue - changes value stored
        
4. Set Package
    * DisjointSets
    	The DisjointSets data structure was given to us and we did not make any modifications to it.
    	It was used in part 2 (Kruskal's Algorithm) when we wanted to determine whether or not two vertices were already connected.
    	In the DisjointSets data structure, each object is initially stored in distinct sets, each represented by a unique integer from 1 to n, where n are the number
    	of objects stored in the set (and the number of distinct sets at the beginning).
    	Note that each object in the set is mapped to a unique integer.
    	Calling find on the integer corresponding to an object returns the root of the set the object is in.
    	Two objects with the same root are in the same set.
    	Calling union on two roots also unions both of the sets together.
  
        * public void union(int root1, int root2) - joins two disjoint sets
        * public int find(int x) - finds the name of the set containing an item and returns the root of the set

5. Set Kruskal
	* KruskalEdge
		We defined our own edge object that is pretty much the same as the Edge object in the set graph.
		A KruskalEdge has a weight represented by an integer and two DListNodes, which represent vertices.
		We also wrote a hashcode for the KruskalEdge which is analogous to Edge in the set graph.

Design Decisions for WUGraph (Part I):
WUGraph
  1. removeVertex() - An Edge object stores three things: two DListNodes 
  and the weight of the edge. Every Vertex has an AdjacencyList that stores 
  all adjacent Vertices. The first DListNode stores a reference to the node 
  storing vertex2 in vertex1's AdjacencyList. The second DListNode stores a 
  reference to the node storing vertex1 in vertex2's AdjacencyList. Using
  these references, an Edge can delete itself in O(1) time.

  removeVertex walks through the vertex's Adjacency List and removes each edge 
  containing the vertex and each adjacent vertex. Since each deletion runs in 
  O(1) time, removeVertex() runs in O(d) time.

  2. getVertices() - WUGraph stores a list of Vertices as an attribute. When
  getVertices is called, the graph simply walks through vertexList and returns 
  the objects that were added to WUGraph.
